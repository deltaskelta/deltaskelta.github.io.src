My first inclination when trying to embed images in MDX via [gatby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx)
was to reach for [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/)
since gatsby-mdx supports gatsby remark plugins, but this left a lot to handled since I still had to figure out a way
to

- style the image and align it properly with the given post
- load it with responsive settings like [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) does

I tried do this by putting the `gatsby-remark-image` image into a component, but there was a bunch of styling that was
already applied to it that needed to be ripped out before I could style it however I wanted. `gatsby-remark-image` does
give a style setting, but there is only one global setting so it must be applied to each image.
[See more here](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx/issues/251).

## But, there is a better way...

First, we must include all the images we want to display in the post, in the frontmatter of the mdx file

```text
---
title: Cool and Interesting Post
images:
  - ./path/to/img.svg
  - ./path/to/other.svg
---
```

Then we can rely on gatsby sharp plugins (which should be installed along with gatsby-image) when we make queries for
the page template which receives the data from the mdx file...

```graphql
...
frontmatter {
  title
  images {
    publicURL
    childImageSharp {
      fluid {
        base64
        tracedSVG
        aspectRatio
        src
        srcSet
        srcWebp
        srcSetWebp
        sizes
        originalImg
        originalName
        presentationWidth
        presentationHeight
      }
    }
  }
}
...
```

So far we have sourced the images when the mdx post is found and parsed, we have then queried each image in the array
via our page graphql query, here is where the cool part comes.

Since the queried images will be sent to the template component, I can render them in a react component and pass them back to
the `MDXRenderer` through `scope` and call them just like other components passed to `MDXRenderer`.

One thing to remember is that not all images have a `childImageSharp` that can be queried with graphql. `svg` files will
not have one, so we need to be able to handle both types of images. I made two components that handle both
`childImageSharp` and plain `src` tags which can accept `align` and `width` options

see the [full implementation here](https://github.com/jeffwillette/jeffwillette.github.io.src/blob/master/src/components/images.tsx)

```typescript
const mdxSharpImg = ({ classes, width, fluid, align }: MDXSharpImgProps) => (
  <StateConsumer>
    {({ mobile }) => (
      <span
        className={c({
          [classes.leftImg]: !mobile && align === 'left',
          [classes.rightImg]: !mobile && align === 'right',
          [classes.mobile]: mobile
        })}
        style={{ width: width || '40%' }}
      >
        <Img fluid={fluid} />
      </span>
    )}
  </StateConsumer>
);

export const MDXSharpImg = withStyles(styles)(mdxSharpImg);

interface MDXSrcImgProps extends BaseProps {
  src: string;
}

const mdxSrcImg = ({ src, classes, width, align }: MDXSrcImgProps) => (
  <StateConsumer>
    {({ mobile }) => (
      <img
        className={c({
          [classes.leftImg]: !mobile && align === 'left',
          [classes.rightImg]: !mobile && align === 'right',
          [classes.mobile]: mobile
        })}
        style={{ width: width || '40%' }}
        src={src}
      />
    )}
  </StateConsumer>
);

export const MDXSrcImg = withStyles(styles)(mdxSrcImg);
```

Now that there are image components which can display the images, I can wrap the components based with the images in
the data from the graphql query that was fed into the page template. In the following code `images` is the resulting
slice of image files from the graphql query

Remember, not all images have a result for `childImageSharp` so check for that first and if it doesn't exist, render
`MDXSrcImage` with the `publicURL`.

see the full implementation [here](https://github.com/jeffwillette/jeffwillette.github.io.src/blob/master/src/templates/blogPost.tsx)
```typescript
// this block is in the render method before returning
const imgs: { [k: string]: React.ReactNode } = {};
if (images) {
  images.forEach((image, i) => {
    const { childImageSharp, publicURL } = safe(image);
    const { fluid } = safe(childImageSharp);
    imgs[`Img${i + 1}`] = ({ align, width }) =>
      f ? (
        <MDXSharpImg align={align} width={width} fluid={fluid || undefined} />
      ) : (
        <MDXSrcImg align={align} width={width} src={publicURL || ''} />
      );
  });
}

// ... and now in the render method, you can do this...
<MDXRenderer imgs={imgs}>{body}</MDXRenderer>
```

<props.imgs.Img1 align="left" width="20%" />
<props.imgs.Img2 align="right" width="20%" />

The images on the left and right here were called with the code...

```typescript.tsx
<props.imgs.Img1 align="left" width="100px" />
<props.imgs.Img2 align="right" width="100px" />
```

This method gives a lot more freedom and flexibility when rendering images because the sharp plugins take care of
rendering placeholders with traced SVG's, resizing, and a lot of cool stuff like
